# Colorful-Ball

## Abstract
> A beautiful drawing
---

## Origin of the project
> Being the curious type that I am, I started studying Python in my spare time and ended up liking several Python 
> developers' pages on Instagram. With this, I am bombarded daily with a plethora of advertisements, suggestions, tips, 
> and, of course, codes. 
> I have already tried to replicate some of them, as I have not yet advanced enough in this language to move forward on 
> my own legs. However, of the codes I chose to replicate and understand some concept, none had actually worked. Until I
> found this one.
> The contents of this repository show the end result of this code.
